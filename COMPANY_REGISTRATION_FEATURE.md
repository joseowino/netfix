## Technical Details

### Form Validation
```python

    """Validate that the username is unique."""
    username = self.cleaned_data.get('username')
    if User.objects.filter(username=username).exists():
        raise ValidationError(f'Username "{username}" is already taken.')
    return username

def clean_email(self):
    """Validate that the email is unique."""
    email = self.cleaned_data.get('email')
    if User.objects.filter(email=email).exists():
        raise ValidationError(f'Email "{email}" is already registered.')
    return email
```

### Atomic User Creation
```python
@transaction.atomic
def save(self, commit=True):
    """Save the user and create associated Company profile."""
    user = super().save(commit=False)
    user.email = self.cleaned_data['email']
    user.is_company = True
    
    if commit:
        user.save()
        # Create Company profile
        Company.objects.create(
            user=user,
            field=self.cleaned_data['field_of_work']
        )
    return user
```
