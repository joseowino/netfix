## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced View Function
```python
def company_profile(request, name):
    user = get_object_or_404(User, username=name)
    
    # Ensure the user is actually a company
    if not user.is_company:
        return render(request, 'main/error.html', {
            'error_message': 'This user is not a company.'
        })
    
    company = Company.objects.get(user=user)
    services = Service.objects.filter(company=company).order_by('-date')
    
    # Calculate statistics
    total_services = services.count()
    total_requests = sum(service.total_requests for service in services)
    average_rating = calculate_average_rating(services)
```

### Service Statistics Calculation
```python
# Calculate some statistics
total_services = services.count()
total_requests = sum(service.total_requests for service in services)
average_rating = 0
if services.exists():
    ratings = [service.average_rating for service in services if service.average_rating > 0]
    if ratings:
        average_rating = sum(ratings) / len(ratings)
```

### Template Structure
```html
<!-- Company Information with Icons -->
<div class="col-12 mb-2">
